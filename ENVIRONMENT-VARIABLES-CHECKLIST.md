# üîê Environment Variables Checklist

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** Migrations Complete ‚úÖ  
**Required Action:** Update Vercel Environment Variables  

---

## ‚úÖ Migrations Status

All migrations have been successfully completed:

- ‚úÖ Migration 1: Multi-tenancy (run-production-migration.js)
- ‚úÖ Migration 2: User events (run-hotfix-migration.js)  
- ‚úÖ Migration 3: Spotify tokens (run-spotify-migration-safe.js)
- ‚úÖ Migration 4: Super admin (run-super-admin-migration.js)
- ‚úÖ Super admin user promoted: `superadmin`

**Database is ready for production! üéâ**

---

## üìã Environment Variables Overview

### ‚úÖ Variables You Already Have (Verify in Vercel)

These should already be set in your Vercel project:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_postgres_connection_string

# JWT Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_random_string_here

# Pusher Real-time
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_pusher_app_id
PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_key
PUSHER_SECRET=your_pusher_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_pusher_cluster

# Spotify OAuth
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret

# App URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
```

---

## üÜï NEW Variables (Optional - Only if Enabling Registration)

**These are ONLY needed if you want to enable public user registration in the future.**

For now, registration is disabled and only the super admin can create accounts, so these are **optional**.

```env
# Email Service (Resend) - For registration/password reset emails
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@your-domain.com

# Base URL (alternative to NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
```

### How to Get Resend API Key (When Needed)

1. Go to https://resend.com
2. Sign up for free account (100 emails/day free tier)
3. Verify your sending domain (or use test mode)
4. Generate API key from dashboard
5. Add to Vercel environment variables

---

## üéØ Current Setup Recommendation

### For Production Launch (Right Now)

**You DON'T need any new environment variables!**

Your current `.env.local` variables are sufficient because:
- Registration is disabled (invitation-only)
- Super admin creates all accounts manually
- No email verification needed
- No password reset emails needed

### When You're Ready for Public Registration

Add these to Vercel:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - For sending emails
- `EMAIL_FROM` - Your verified sending address

---

## üîç Vercel Environment Variables Setup

### How to Add/Verify Variables in Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   ```
   https://vercel.com/your-account/party-playlist-request/settings/environment-variables
   ```

2. **Check Existing Variables**
   Verify these are all set:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `JWT_SECRET`
   - `PUSHER_APP_ID`
   - `PUSHER_KEY`
   - `PUSHER_SECRET`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER`
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
   - `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

3. **Add New Variables (Optional)**
   If you want to enable registration later:
   - Click "Add New"
   - Name: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your Resend API key
   - Environment: Production, Preview, Development
   - Click "Save"

4. **Redeploy**
   After adding any new variables, redeploy your app:
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click "..." on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"

## üîí Security Best Practices

### JWT_SECRET
- Should be at least 32 characters
- Use random characters (letters, numbers, symbols)
- Never commit to git
- Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`

### Secrets Management
- Never expose secrets in client-side code
- Only variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to client
- Keep API keys and secrets server-side only

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to database"
- Check `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- Verify database accepts connections from Vercel IPs
- Check SSL settings in connection string

### Issue: "JWT verification failed"
- Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set in Vercel
- Check it matches between environments
- Try logging out and back in

### Issue: "Pusher connection failed"
- Check all Pusher env vars are set
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY` is public (client accessible)
- Check cluster matches your Pusher app region
- Verify key/secret are from same Pusher app

### Issue: "Spotify OAuth fails"
- Update redirect URI in Spotify Developer Dashboard
- Must be: `https://your-domain.com/api/spotify/callback`
- Check Client ID and Secret are correct
- Verify Spotify app is in Development or Extended Quota mode

### Issue: Can't access superadmin
- Run: `node migrations/set-superadmin-role.js your-username`
- Logout and login again
- Check browser console for errors
