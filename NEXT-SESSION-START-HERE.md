# 🚀 Next Session: Start Here

**Last Session:** 2025-01-06 (CONTINUED)  
**Current Branch:** `phase1/auth-and-landing`  
**Status:** Spotify auth FIXED ✅ - Ready for continued testing

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Spotify Re-Authentication Fix**

**Issue:** RESOLVED ✅  
**Root Cause:** Spotify endpoints were using old `authService.requireAdminAuth()` instead of new `requireAuth()` middleware

**What Was Fixed:**
- ✅ `/api/spotify/auth` - Updated to JWT authentication
- ✅ `/api/spotify/disconnect` - Updated to JWT authentication  
- ✅ `/api/spotify/oauth-session` - Updated to JWT authentication
- ✅ Tested successfully - redirects to Spotify login page
- ✅ No more "Failed to start Spotify authentication" error

**Documentation:** See `tasks/SPOTIFY-AUTH-ISSUE-RESOLVED.md`
