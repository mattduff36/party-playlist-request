- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- Integration tests should cover cross-device synchronization scenarios.
- Performance tests should verify 350+ concurrent user support.
- E2E tests should cover complete user workflows across all three states.
