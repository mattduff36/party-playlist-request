# Session 2 - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-06 (Continued)  
**Branch:** `phase1/auth-and-landing`  
**Status:** ✅ Major Progress - Spotify Auth Fixed, Search Fixed, E2E Partially Tested

---

## 🎉 Major Achievements

### 1. ✅ Spotify Authentication Fixed
**Problem:** Users couldn't reconnect to Spotify after disconnecting  
**Root Cause:** Endpoints were using old `authService.requireAdminAuth()` instead of new `requireAuth()` middleware  
**Solution:**
- Updated `/api/spotify/auth` to use JWT authentication
- Updated `/api/spotify/disconnect` to use JWT authentication
- Updated `/api/spotify/oauth-session` to use JWT authentication
- **Tested:** Successfully redirects to Spotify login page ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/spotify/auth/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/spotify/disconnect/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/spotify/oauth-session/route.ts`

### 2. ✅ Public Search Fixed (CRITICAL INSIGHT!)
**Problem:** Initially implemented wrong - used Client Credentials (app-level auth)  
**Correct Behavior:** Uses event owner's Spotify tokens (per-user)

**How It Works:**
1. Admin connects Spotify in their admin panel
2. Their tokens are stored in `spotify_auth` table with `user_id`
3. Public request page searches using THOSE tokens
4. If admin disconnects → search stops working for guests

**Implementation:**
- `/api/spotify/search` accepts `username` parameter
- Looks up that user's Spotify tokens from database
- Uses their tokens to search (not Client Credentials)
- Auto-refreshes expired tokens
- Returns 503 if user hasn't connected Spotify

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/spotify/search/route.ts` - Complete rewrite
- `src/app/[username]/request/page.tsx` - Pass username to search
- `src/lib/spotify.ts` - Removed unused Client Credentials code

### 3. ✅ E2E Testing Progress
**Successfully Tested:**
- ✅ User registration (`testspotify` user created)
- ✅ JWT-based login
- ✅ Event creation (set to Live status)
- ✅ PIN-protected request page access (PIN: 5742)
- ✅ Request page UI matches original design exactly
- ✅ Name field before search field ✅
- ✅ Search disabled until name entered ✅
- ✅ Logout button in top-right ✅
- ✅ Debug footer showing @testspotify ✅

**Blocked On:**
- ⏸️ Search testing - requires Spotify connection
- ⏸️ Request submission - requires Spotify connection to get track info

## 🧪 Testing Status

### ✅ Tested & Working
1. User registration/login with JWT
2. Multi-tenant routing (`/:username/`)
3. Admin overview page
4. Event controls (Offline/Standby/Live)
5. PIN generation and verification
6. Request page access control
7. Request page UI (matches original exactly)
8. Spotify OAuth redirect (first step)

### ⏸️ Pending Test (Requires Spotify Connection)
1. Complete Spotify OAuth callback
2. Public search functionality
3. Request submission
4. Admin request approval
5. Display page with real-time updates

### 📋 Next Test Steps
1. **Connect Spotify:** Complete OAuth flow for `testspotify` user
2. **Test Search:** Try searching for songs on request page
3. **Submit Request:** Request a song from public page
4. **Admin Approval:** Approve request in admin panel
5. **Display Page:** Verify display page shows requests

## 🎯 Critical Insights Learned

### Multi-Tenant Spotify Architecture
```
Single-Tenant (Old):
- ONE set of Spotify tokens in database
- ALL users share same connection
- spotifyService.searchTracks() uses those tokens

Multi-Tenant (New):
- Each user has THEIR OWN tokens (user_id foreign key)
- Public pages use event owner's tokens
- Must pass username to identify which tokens to use
```

### Search Flow
```
Guest visits: /:username/request
  ↓
Enters PIN or uses bypass token
  ↓
Types song name in search
  ↓
Calls: /api/spotify/search?q=song&username=testspotify
  ↓
Server looks up testspotify's Spotify tokens
  ↓
Uses THOSE tokens to search Spotify API
  ↓
Returns results to guest
```

### Why This Matters
- Each DJ/event owner maintains their own Spotify connection
- Guests search using the DJ's library/recommendations
- If DJ disconnects → their event goes offline for guests
- Perfect isolation between different events/users

## 🐛 Issues Discovered & Fixed

### Issue #1: Spotify Re-Authentication Failure
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **See:** `tasks/SPOTIFY-AUTH-ISSUE-RESOLVED.md`

### Issue #2: Wrong Search Implementation
- **Problem:** Used Client Credentials (app-level) instead of user tokens
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Lesson:** Public features still use per-user resources in multi-tenant

## 🚀 Next Session Priority

### IMMEDIATE: Complete Spotify OAuth for Testing
1. Connect `testspotify` user's Spotify account
2. Test search on request page
3. Submit a test request
4. Verify request appears in admin panel

### THEN: Continue Backend Updates
- 12 routes remaining (40%)
- See `docs/BACKEND-AUTH-STATUS.md`

### FINALLY: Full E2E Test
- Complete flow: register → connect Spotify → enable pages → test all features
- Test with 2 different users for isolation verification

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### 1. Add Spotify Connection Validation
Prevent enabling request/display pages until Spotify is connected:
```typescript
// In admin panel page controls
if (!spotifyConnected) {
  return <div>Connect Spotify before enabling public pages</div>
}
```

### 2. Better Error Messages on Request Page
If search fails because Spotify not connected:
```typescript
// Show helpful message to guests
"The DJ hasn't connected their Spotify account yet. 
Please ask them to connect in the admin panel."
```

### 3. Token Refresh Testing
Test what happens when:
- Token expires mid-search
- Token is revoked by Spotify
- User disconnects while guests are searching
