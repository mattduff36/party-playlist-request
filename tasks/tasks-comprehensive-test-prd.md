# Party Playlist Request - Comprehensive Testing Tasks

## Current Status Summary

### âœ… **COMPLETED:**
- Task 1.1: Navigation Button Selectors (Desktop) - Fixed
- Performance Issues - No endless API calls, stable memory
- Authentication System - Working correctly
- Real-time Updates - Polling active (15s intervals)
- Spotify Integration - Data flowing correctly
- Request System - 11 requests being processed

### ðŸš¨ **CURRENT ISSUES:**

- Mobile Navigation - Needs different selectors
- Stats Display - Numbers not showing despite data availability

## Relevant Files

- `src/app/admin/overview/page.tsx` - Main admin overview page where Now Playing should display
- `src/hooks/useAdminData.ts` - Hook managing admin data flow and real-time updates
- `src/hooks/useNowPlayingProgress.ts` - Hook for now playing progress tracking
- `src/hooks/useRealtimeUpdates.ts` - Real-time update management (SSE/polling)
- `src/components/AdminLayout.tsx` - Admin layout component with navigation
- `src/contexts/AdminDataContext.tsx` - Context provider for admin data
- `tests/task-*.spec.ts` - Existing task-specific test files

### Notes

- Focus on UI rendering issues rather than data flow (data is working)
- Mobile navigation uses different selectors than desktop
- Tests should verify both functionality and UI display
- Priority is on completing existing partially-done tasks
