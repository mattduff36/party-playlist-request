# Notice Board Fix - Current Status

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Status:** ⚠️ FIX IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT DEPLOYED

## Summary

The fix has been implemented in the code, but the Next.js dev server hasn't recompiled the critical API route yet. A **dev server restart is required**.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Display Page ✅ DEPLOYED
**File:** `src/app/[username]/display/page.tsx`  
**Change:** Added `onMessageUpdate` handler to receive Pusher `message-update` events  
**Status:** ✅ Code deployed (Fast Refresh completed)

### 2. Approval API Route ❌ NOT DEPLOYED YET
**File:** `src/app/api/admin/approve/[id]/route.ts`  
**Change:** Added comprehensive logging and message queue integration  
**Status:** ❌ Code changed but NOT recompiled by Next.js  

##  Evidence

### Client-Side (Display Page)
- ✅ Fast Refresh completed twice (seen in browser console)
- ✅ New code is active in the browser
- ✅ Ready to receive `message-update` events

### Server-Side (Approval API)
- ❌ No diagnostic logs appearing (`📋 [admin/approve] Event settings retrieved`)
- ❌ No message queue logs (`📨 [MessageQueue] Message queued`)
- ❌ API route still running old code

### Test Results
- Approved 3 requests (Bohemian Rhapsody, Sweet Caroline x2)
- ✅ Requests approved successfully
- ✅ Added to Spotify queue
- ❌ **NO notice board messages appeared**
- ❌ **NO `message-update` Pusher events fired**

## Root Cause

Next.js dev server's hot module replacement (HMR) successfully recompiled the **frontend** React component (`display/page.tsx`) but **did not recompile** the **backend** API route (`api/admin/approve/[id]/route.ts`).

This is a known limitation of Next.js HMR where API routes sometimes require a manual server restart to pick up changes.

## Solution

**Restart the Next.js dev server:**

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

After restart, the approval API route will have the new message queue code and will:
1. Check `show_approval_messages` setting ✅
2. Queue the notice board message ✅
3. Trigger Pusher `message-update` event ✅
4. Display page will receive the event ✅
5. Notice board message will appear for 10 seconds ✅

## Expected Behavior After Restart

When you approve a request, you should see in the **server logs**:
```
📋 [admin/approve] Event settings retrieved: {show_approval_messages: true, ...}
📢 [admin/approve] Queueing auto-approval message: "PartyPlaylist Suggestion..."
📨 [MessageQueue] Message queued for user ... Queue length: 1
📤 [MessageQueue] Sending message for user ...
✅ [MessageQueue] Database updated for user ...
✅ [MessageQueue] Message sent successfully to user ... via Pusher
✅ [admin/approve] Auto-approval message queued successfully
```

And in the **display page browser console**:
```
💬 Pusher: Message update {message_text: "...", message_duration: 10, ...}
📢 PUSHER: Message update received! {...}
📢 Notice board message updated: "PartyPlaylist Suggestion..."
```

Then the notice board message will appear in the center of the display screen for 10 seconds.

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/[username]/display/page.tsx` - Added `onMessageUpdate` handler
2. ✅ `src/app/api/admin/approve/[id]/route.ts` - Added message queue integration
3. ✅ `src/lib/message-queue.ts` - Already correct
4. ✅ `src/hooks/usePusher.ts` - Already has `message-update` binding

## Testing After Restart

1. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Log in to admin panel
3. Approve any pending request
4. Check server logs for diagnostic messages
5. Check display screen for 10-second notice board message
6. Success! 🎉

## Next Steps

1. **Restart dev server** (required)
2. Test the approval flow
3. Verify notice board message appears
4. Commit the changes if working
