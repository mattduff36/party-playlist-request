# Progress Checkpoint - Stopping for Error Fix

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Frontend (100%)
- ✅ Overview page rebuilt with JWT
- ✅ 7 admin components updated to JWT cookies
- ✅ AdminDataContext fully refactored (all 14 fetch calls)

### Database Layer (100%)
- ✅ `getAllRequests(userId?)` - user filtering
- ✅ `getRequestsByStatus(status, limit, offset, userId?)` - user filtering
- ✅ `getRequestsCount(userId?)` - user filtering
- ✅ `getRequest(id, userId?)` - ownership verification
- ✅ `verifyRequestOwnership(requestId, userId)` - helper function

### Backend APIs (10/30 routes = 33%)
**Fully Updated with JWT + User-Scoping:**
1. ✅ GET `/api/admin/requests` - filters by user_id
2. ✅ GET `/api/admin/stats` - filters by user_id
3. ✅ GET `/api/admin/event-settings` - extracts user_id
4. ✅ POST `/api/admin/event-settings` - extracts user_id
5. ✅ POST `/api/admin/approve/[id]` - ownership verification
6. ✅ POST `/api/admin/reject/[id]` - ownership verification
7. ✅ DELETE `/api/admin/delete/[id]` - ownership verification
8. ✅ GET `/api/admin/queue/details` - JWT auth
9. ✅ POST `/api/admin/queue/reorder` - JWT auth

**Still Need Updating (~20 routes):**
- Playback controls (pause/resume/skip)
- Other queue operations
- Spotify routes
- Database admin routes
- Message route
- Others (see BACKEND-AUTH-STATUS.md)

## 🎯 Current State

**What Works:**
- ✅ JWT authentication (login/register)
- ✅ User-scoped requests filtering
- ✅ User-scoped stats
- ✅ Ownership verification for approve/reject/delete
- ✅ Multi-tenant data isolation (for implemented routes)

**What's Partially Working:**
- 🚧 Some API routes still using old authService
- 🚧 Settings not yet user-scoped
- 🚧 Events not yet user-scoped
- 🚧 Spotify tokens not yet user-scoped

---

## 🔧 Next Steps (After Error Fix)

1. **Continue Backend API Updates** (~20 routes remaining)
   - Playback controls
   - Spotify-related routes
   - Event management routes

2. **User-Scope Settings & Events**
   - Update event settings queries
   - Connect to user_events table
   - Per-user settings storage

3. **Spotify Multi-Tenancy**
   - Per-user Spotify token storage
   - User-specific Spotify connection status

4. **Test Full Flow**
   - Register → Login → Overview
   - Create event → Request song
   - Approve → Play
