## üîê Environment Variables Required

Add these to your Vercel production environment:

### Existing Variables (Verify These)
```env
DATABASE_URL=your_production_postgres_url
JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret_here
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_pusher_id
PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_key
PUSHER_SECRET=your_pusher_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY=your_pusher_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER=your_cluster
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret

```

---

## üìã Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub ‚úÖ DONE
```bash
# Already completed!
git checkout main
git merge phase1/auth-and-landing
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Vercel Automatic Deployment
Vercel should automatically deploy when you push to `main`. Check:
- Go to https://vercel.com/your-username/party-playlist-request
- Look for the new deployment in progress
- Wait for build to complete

### Step 3: Run Database Migrations
**IMPORTANT:** Do this BEFORE accessing the production site!

Option A: Run locally pointing to production database
```bash
# In your local terminal
# Make sure DATABASE_URL points to production in .env.local temporarily
node migrations/run-production-migration.js
node migrations/run-hotfix-migration.js
node migrations/run-spotify-migration.js
node migrations/run-super-admin-migration.js
```

Option B: Use Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel env pull .env.production
# Then run migrations with production DATABASE_URL
```

### Step 4: Create Your Super Admin Account
```bash
# After migrations, promote your user to superadmin
node migrations/set-superadmin-role.js your-username

# Or if you need to create a new user first:
# 1. Login to production
# 2. Go to /superadmin (you'll be redirected to login)
# 3. Run the script above
# 4. Login again
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment
Visit these URLs in production:

1. **Landing Page:** `https://your-domain.com/`
   - Should show Spotify-themed landing page
   
2. **Login:** `https://your-domain.com/login`
   - Should show login form with Spotify colors
   
3. **Super Admin:** (after promotion)
   - Login with your superadmin account
   - Should redirect to `/superadmin`
   - Create a test user
   
4. **User Admin Panel:** `https://your-domain.com/testuser/admin/overview`
   - Login as test user
   - Should see admin panel with Spotify theme
   
5. **Request Page:** `https://your-domain.com/testuser/request`
   - Should show PIN entry or 'Party Not Started'
   
6. **Display Page:** `https://your-domain.com/testuser/display`
   - Should show display screen

## üß™ Post-Deployment Testing

### Critical Path Tests

1. **Super Admin Flow**
   - [ ] Login as superadmin
   - [ ] Access `/superadmin`
   - [ ] Create a new user
   - [ ] Edit user details
   - [ ] Verify user list loads

2. **User Authentication**
   - [ ] Login as regular user
   - [ ] Redirects to `/:username/admin/overview`
   - [ ] Can access all admin pages
   - [ ] Logout works

3. **Event Management**
   - [ ] Create/start event (generates PIN)
   - [ ] Event status changes (Offline ‚Üí Standby ‚Üí Live)
   - [ ] Page controls work (enable/disable request/display)
   - [ ] PIN authentication on request page

4. **Spotify Integration**
   - [ ] Connect Spotify account
   - [ ] View devices
   - [ ] Search for songs
   - [ ] Submit request
   - [ ] Approve request
   - [ ] Song added to queue

5. **Display Screen**
   - [ ] Access display page with token
   - [ ] Shows current song
   - [ ] Shows approved requests
   - [ ] Updates in real-time

6. **Real-Time Updates (Pusher)**
   - [ ] Open admin in two browsers
   - [ ] Change event status in one
   - [ ] Verify it updates in the other
   - [ ] Test with different users (should be isolated)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

### Current State
1. **Registration Disabled:** Public registration is turned off
   - Only superadmin can create accounts
   - This is intentional until you set up payment system

2. **Email Service:** Requires Resend API key
   - Not needed for basic functionality
   - Only needed if you enable registration later

3. **Spotify Watcher:** Some Pusher events disabled
   - `spotify-watcher` route has TODOs for per-user refactor
   - Non-critical, doesn't affect main functionality

### Migration Considerations
1. **Existing Data:** 
   - Migration 1 will migrate your existing single-user data
   - All existing requests will be assigned to the default user
   - Existing Spotify tokens will be migrated

2. **Pusher Channels:**
   - Old global channels will still exist
   - New user-specific channels are now used
   - No conflicts, but old channels can be ignored

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something goes wrong:

### Option 1: Revert on Vercel
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Find previous deployment (before merge)
3. Click "Redeploy"
4. This WILL NOT revert database changes

### Option 2: Revert Git
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Database Rollback
**CAUTION:** Only do this if you backed up your database first!
- Restore from backup taken before migration
- You'll lose any new data created after deployment

---

## üìä Monitoring After Deployment

### Things to Watch

1. **Error Logs:**
   - Check Vercel function logs for errors
   - Look for authentication failures
   - Watch for database connection issues

2. **Performance:**
   - Page load times
   - API response times
   - Pusher connection status

3. **User Issues:**
   - Can users login?
   - Are events being created?
   - Is Spotify connecting?

### Vercel Dashboard
- Go to: https://vercel.com/your-username/party-playlist-request
- Check "Functions" tab for API errors
- Check "Analytics" for performance
- Check "Logs" for real-time issues

---

## üéØ Next Steps After Deployment

### Immediate (Day 1)

2. [ ] Create your superadmin account
3. [ ] Create 1-2 test users
4. [ ] Test the complete flow end-to-end
5. [ ] Monitor for errors for 24 hours

### Short Term (Week 1)
1. [ ] Invite beta testers (if any)
2. [ ] Test with real Spotify usage
3. [ ] Monitor Pusher usage/limits
4. [ ] Check database performance
5. [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry?)

### Medium Term (Month 1)
1. [ ] Decide on payment/subscription model
2. [ ] Enable public registration (if desired)
3. [ ] Set up Resend for emails
4. [ ] Create Terms of Service page

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Authentication required" errors
- Check JWT_SECRET is set in production
- Verify cookies are being set (check HTTPS)
- Check browser console for cookie issues

### Issue: Pusher not connecting
- Verify all Pusher env vars are set
- Check NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY is correct
- Look for CORS issues in console

### Issue: Database connection fails
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
- Check database is accessible from Vercel
- Verify SSL settings

### Issue: Spotify not connecting
- Check redirect URI in Spotify dashboard
- Should be: `https://your-domain.com/api/spotify/callback`
- Verify SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SECRET

### Issue: Can't access superadmin
- Run: `node migrations/set-superadmin-role.js your-username`
- Make sure user exists in database
- Try logging out and back in
