# Portrait Mode Fix for Notice Board Messages
**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  
**Branch:** `main`  
**Commit:** `c19a1f8`

## üéØ Objective

When a notice board message appears on the display screen, the **Now Playing** and **QR Code** sections needed to automatically switch to **portrait/vertical layout** to accommodate the narrower space.

Previously, these sections would attempt to maintain their horizontal/landscape layout, causing content to be cramped or cut off when the notice board appeared.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Key Change
Added a computed layout value that **forces portrait mode** when a message is visible:

```typescript
// üñºÔ∏è Force portrait/vertical layout when notice board message is visible
// This ensures Now Playing and QR Code switch to portrait mode when a message appears
const finalUseHorizontalLayout = isMessageVisible ? false : useHorizontalLayout;
```

### How It Works

1. **Normal State (No Message)**
   - `isMessageVisible = false`
   - `finalUseHorizontalLayout = useHorizontalLayout` (determined by ResizeObserver based on container dimensions)
   - Now Playing and QR Code use horizontal layout if there's enough space

2. **Message Visible State**
   - `isMessageVisible = true`
   - `finalUseHorizontalLayout = false` (forced to portrait)
   - Now Playing and QR Code **always** use vertical/portrait layout
   - Content stacks vertically: image on top, text below

3. **Message Disappears**
   - `isMessageVisible = false`
   - Layout smoothly transitions back to horizontal (if space allows)

## üìê Layout Behavior

### Portrait Mode (Message Visible)
**Now Playing:**
- Album art centered at top (140px √ó 140px)
- Track name below
- Artist name below
- Album name at bottom

**QR Code:**
- QR code centered at top
- "Request your song now!" text below

### Landscape Mode (No Message)
**Now Playing:**
- Album art on left (300px √ó 300px)
- Track details on right (centered vertically)

**QR Code:**
- QR code on left (300px √ó 300px)
- Request instructions on right (centered vertically)

## üîÑ Smooth Transitions

The layout transitions are handled by CSS transitions already in place:
- Grid column changes: `1s ease-in-out`
- Content layout changes are handled by the conditional rendering

This creates a seamless experience where:
1. Notice board message slides in from the right
2. Now Playing and QR Code smoothly transition to portrait layout
3. Message displays for its duration
4. Message slides out
5. Now Playing and QR Code transition back to landscape (if space allows)

---

## üß™ Testing

### Test Scenario
1. Start with display screen in landscape mode (no message)
2. Approve a request with "Show Requests when Approved" enabled
3. **Expected:** Notice board appears, Now Playing and QR Code switch to portrait
4. Wait for message to finish (10 seconds)
5. **Expected:** Message disappears, Now Playing and QR Code switch back to landscape

### Visual Verification
- ‚úÖ Album art and QR code should be clearly visible and not cramped
- ‚úÖ Text should be readable and properly aligned
- ‚úÖ Transitions should be smooth without jarring jumps
- ‚úÖ No content should be cut off or overflow

## üìù Files Changed

### Modified
- `src/app/[username]/display/page.tsx`
  - Added `finalUseHorizontalLayout` computed value (line 201)
  - Updated Now Playing conditional render to use `finalUseHorizontalLayout` (line 1000)
  - Updated QR Code conditional render to use `finalUseHorizontalLayout` (line 1056)

---

## üéâ Result

The display screen now provides an optimal viewing experience:
- **With messages:** Portrait layout maximizes use of narrower space
- **Without messages:** Landscape layout maximizes use of full width
- **Transitions:** Smooth and professional appearance

This ensures the notice board feature integrates seamlessly with the existing display layout without compromising the user experience.
