# üéµ **Complete Spotify App Setup Guide**

## **üìã What You Need to Do**

Since I can't create the Spotify app for you (it requires your personal Spotify account), here's exactly what you need to do:

### **Step 1: Create Your Spotify Developer App**

1. **Go to Spotify Developer Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
   - Click "Log In" and sign in with your Spotify account

2. **Create New App**
   - Click the green "Create App" button
   - Fill in these **exact details**:

   ```
   App Name: Party DJ Request System
   App Description: Web application for party song requests with DJ approval system
   Website: http://localhost:3000
   Redirect URI: http://localhost:3001/api/spotify/callback
   Which API/SDKs: Web API ‚úì
   ```

3. **Get Your Credentials**
   - After creating the app, copy your **Client ID** (visible on main page)
   - Click "View client secret" and copy your **Client Secret**
   - **Keep these secure!**

### **Step 2: Update Your Configuration**

Replace the placeholder values in `/workspace/backend/.env`:

```env
# Replace these with your actual Spotify app credentials:
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret_here
```

### **Step 3: Test Your Setup**

1. **Run the verification script**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace
   node verify-setup.js
   ```

2. **Start the applications**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the connection**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/admin
   - Login: `admin` / `admin123`
   - Click "üéµ Spotify Setup" button
   - Click "Connect Spotify Account"

## **üéØ Spotify App Settings (Important!)**

When creating your Spotify app, make sure these settings are **exactly** correct:

### **Redirect URIs** (Critical!)
```
Development: http://localhost:3001/api/spotify/callback
Production: https://your-backend-domain.com/api/spotify/callback
```

### **Website**
```
Development: http://localhost:3000
Production: https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

### **Required Scopes** (Automatically requested)
- `user-modify-playback-state` - Add songs to queue
- `user-read-playback-state` - Check what's playing  
- `user-read-currently-playing` - Get current track
- `playlist-modify-public` - Modify public playlists
- `playlist-modify-private` - Modify private playlists
- `user-read-private` - Get user profile

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Requirements**

### **For Testing**
- Any Spotify account works for testing search functionality
- Spotify Premium **required** for playback control (skip, pause, queue)

### **For Production**
- Update redirect URIs in your Spotify app settings
- HTTPS required (Spotify doesn't work with HTTP in production)
- Premium account required for the DJ/host

## **üöÄ Quick Start Checklist**

## **üîç Troubleshooting**

### **"Invalid redirect URI" Error**
- Check that redirect URI is exactly: `http://localhost:3001/api/spotify/callback`
- No trailing slashes, exact case match required

### **"Invalid client" Error**  
- Double-check Client ID and Client Secret for typos
- Make sure no extra spaces when copying

### **"No active device" Error**
- Open Spotify app on any device (phone, computer, etc.)
- Start playing any song
- Device will then be available for control

### **Search Not Working**
- Verify Spotify authentication completed successfully
- Check browser console for error messages
- Ensure backend is running and accessible

## **üì± Testing the Full Flow**

1. **As DJ/Admin**:
   - Login to admin panel
   - Connect Spotify account
   - Start playing music on any device
   - Monitor the request queue

2. **As Guest** (different browser/incognito):

   - Search for a song
   - Submit a request
   - See it appear in admin panel

3. **As DJ** (approve the request):
   - Click "‚úÖ Approve" in admin panel
