# 🐛 CRITICAL Multi-Tenant Bug - FIXED

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🚨 Bug Report

### Issue Discovered
User reported: "I just signed in as 'testuser' and disabled the display screen, and the display screen for 'testspotify' user turned off."

**Impact:** Users were sharing the same event state - changes by one user affected ALL users!

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The `getEvent()` method in `database-service.ts` was **NOT filtering by user_id**:

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - No user filtering
async getEvent(eventId?: string): Promise<Event | null> {
  if (eventId) {
    return drizzle.select().from(events)
      .where(eq(events.id, eventId))  // Only filtering by eventId
      .limit(1);
  } else {
    return drizzle.select().from(events)
      .orderBy(desc(events.updated_at))  // Just getting first event!
      .limit(1);
  }
}
```

This meant:
- When `testuser` called `/api/event/status`, it fetched the first event in DB
- When `testspotify` called the same endpoint, it also fetched the first event
- **Both users were modifying the SAME event record!**

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Updated Method Signature
```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Requires userId
async getEvent(userId: string, eventId?: string): Promise<Event | null> {
  if (eventId) {
    return drizzle.select().from(events)
      .where(and(
        eq(events.id, eventId), 
        eq(events.user_id, userId)  // ✅ Filter by user!
      ))
      .limit(1);
  } else {
    return drizzle.select().from(events)
      .where(eq(events.user_id, userId))  // ✅ Filter by user!
      .orderBy(desc(events.updated_at))
      .limit(1);
  }
}
```

### Updated All Callers
1. **`/api/event/status` (GET)**
   ```typescript
   const event = await dbService.getEvent(userId);  // ✅ Now passes userId
   ```

2. **`/api/event/status` (POST)**
   ```typescript
   const currentEvent = await dbService.getEvent(userId, eventId);  // ✅ Now passes userId
   ```

3. **`/api/event/pages` (GET & POST)**
   ```typescript
   const event = await dbService.getEvent(userId);  // ✅ Now passes userId
   ```

## 🎯 Additional Fixes

### 1. Display Settings Link Added
**Issue:** "I cannot see the new 'display settings' link in the side nav bar"

**Fixed in:** `src/components/AdminLayout.tsx`

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE
{ 
  id: 'display', 
  label: 'Display', 
  icon: Monitor, 
  href: `${baseRoute}/display`  // Wrong - goes to public display
},

// ✅ AFTER
{ 
  id: 'display', 
  label: 'Display', 
  icon: Eye,  // Better icon
  href: `${baseRoute}/admin/display`  // Correct - goes to settings
},
```

### 2. Spotify Watcher Disabled
The global Spotify watcher was also calling `getEvent()` without userId. This needs a per-user refactor, so disabled for now with a TODO.

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Event Isolation
1. Login as `testuser`
2. Set event to "Live"
3. Enable display page
4. **In a different browser/incognito:**
5. Login as `testspotify`
6. Check event status - should be independent
7. Toggle display - should NOT affect testuser
8. ✅ **Events should be completely isolated**

### Test 2: Display Settings Link
1. Login to any admin panel
2. Look at sidebar navigation
3. Click "Display" link
4. ✅ **Should go to Display Settings page, not public display**

---

## 📊 Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ All users shared one event
- ❌ Cross-user interference
- ❌ Not truly multi-tenant
- ❌ Security issue (user A could control user B's event)

### After Fix
- ✅ Each user has their own event(s)
- ✅ Complete data isolation
- ✅ True multi-tenancy
- ✅ No cross-user interference
- ✅ Secure by design

---

## 🔒 Data Isolation Now Complete

### What's Isolated by User
1. ✅ **Requests** - Each user's song requests (fixed earlier)
2. ✅ **Events** - Event status & page controls (fixed now!)
3. ✅ **Spotify Tokens** - User-specific auth
4. ✅ **Event Settings** - Event title, messages, etc.
5. ✅ **Display Pages** - Each user's display is independent
6. ✅ **Request Pages** - Each user's request form is independent

---

## 📝 Notes

- This was a **critical** bug that broke multi-tenancy
- The fix ensures every database query for events includes `user_id`
- All API endpoints now properly scope events by authenticated user
- Pusher events are already user-specific (private channels)

---

## ✅ Status: READY FOR TESTING

The multi-tenant isolation is now complete. Each user operates in their own isolated environment with no cross-contamination.
