# ðŸš€ Production Readiness Audit

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… READY FOR PRODUCTION  
**Codebase Version:** Clean, optimized, multi-tenant

---

## âœ… Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Database
- [x] All tables use `user_id` for data isolation
- [x] Requests are scoped to specific users
- [x] Spotify auth tokens are user-specific
- [x] Events are linked to user accounts
- [x] Database queries filter by `userId`

### API Routes
- [x] All Spotify calls pass `userId` parameter
- [x] All database queries include user filtering
- [x] Pusher events use user-specific channels
- [x] Admin routes require authentication
- [x] Public routes validate username/pin

### Real-Time Updates
- [x] Pusher uses per-user channels: `user-{userId}`, `admin-{userId}`
- [x] Spotify watcher tracks state per-user (Map objects)
- [x] No cross-contamination between parties
- [x] Display screens only show their own data

---

## âœ… Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Event Settings (Global)**
   - Currently one set of settings for all users
   - Not critical for MVP, can be made per-user later
   - Documented in code comments

2. **Spotify Queue Reordering**
   - Spotify API doesn't support queue reordering
   - UI shows reordering but doesn't persist to Spotify
   - Documented clearly for users

3. **Notifications Endpoint**
   - Currently disabled pending proper implementation
   - Not critical for core functionality
   - Admin gets real-time updates via Pusher
